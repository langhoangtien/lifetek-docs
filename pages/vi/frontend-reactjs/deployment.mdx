# Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying the frontend of your Vite-based React project to an Ubuntu server, which must have Nginx installed. The guide includes both manual deployment and deployment via GitLab CI/CD.

## Server Requirements

- The server must be running **Ubuntu** with **Nginx** installed to serve the frontend build files.
- For GitLab CI/CD, the server must allow SSH connections, and you will need to provide a private SSH key to authenticate the deployment.

## Manual Deployment

To deploy manually, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application**

   On your local development machine, run the build command to generate the `dist/` folder containing the static files:

   ```bash npm2yarn copy
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload the Build Files to the VPS**

   Use scp (or a similar tool like rsync) to transfer the `dist/ `folder to your Ubuntu server:

   ```bash copy
   scp -r dist/ root@$VPS_IP:/home/frontend
   ```

- `-r`: This option means "recursive," so it will upload the entire `dist/` directory and its contents.
- `root@$VPS_IP`: Replace `$VPS_IP` with the actual IP address of your VPS. For example, if your VPS IP is `103.124.94.148`, use `root@103.124.94.148`.
- `/home/frontend`: This is the destination directory on the VPS where you want to upload the files. You can modify this path to match the desired location on your server.

## Deployment via GitLab CI/CD

    You can automate the build and deployment process using GitLab CI/CD. Below are the steps for configuring GitLab CI/CD to deploy the frontend automatically when changes are made to the `main` branch.

### GitLab CI/CD Configuration

**1. File `.gitlab-ci.yml`**

This GitLab CI/CD configuration file automatically builds and deploys the frontend to your Ubuntu server via SSH when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

```yml filename=".gitlab-ci.yml" copy
image: "node:18-alpine"

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

before_script:
  - npm install --legacy-peer-deps

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
  only:
    - main

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - main
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache openssh-client
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    - echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - ssh-keyscan -H $VPS_IP >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  script:
    - "scp -r dist/ root@$VPS_IP:/home/frontend"
```

### Steps to Set Up GitLab CI/CD

**1. Create an SSH Key Pair**

On your local machine, generate an SSH key pair to authenticate the connection to your server.

Run the following command and follow the prompts to create the key:

```bash copy
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

By default, the keys will be saved in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. You can use these default names or specify different ones.

**2. Copy the Public Key to the VPS**

Copy the generated public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your VPS to allow SSH access.

Run this command:

```bash copy
ssh-copy-id root@$VPS_IP
```

**3. Set Up GitLab CI/CD Variables**

Next, you need to configure the necessary variables on GitLab for the CI/CD pipeline.

- Go to your **GitLab project** and navigate to **Settings > CI / CD > Variables**.

- Add the following variables:

  - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Paste the contents of your private SSH key (`id_rsa` file).
  - `VPS_IP`: Set the IP address or domain name of your VPS server.

**4. Trigger the CI/CD Pipeline**

Every time you push code to the main branch, GitLab CI/CD will automatically build and deploy the frontend to your VPS server.

## Summary

You can deploy your frontend application either manually or using GitLab CI/CD. The server must be running Ubuntu with Nginx installed to serve the static files.

- For manual deployment, you upload the build files (dist/) directly to the server via SCP.
- For CI/CD deployment, GitLab automates the build and deployment process to your server, provided you've configured the necessary SSH keys and environment variables on GitLab.
