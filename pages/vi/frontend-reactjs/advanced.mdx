# Guide to Gzip Compression and Nginx Configuration for Vite Project

## Step 1: Install the `vite-plugin-compression` Plugin for Vite

To begin compressing static files when building your project, you need to use the `vite-plugin-compression` plugin in your Vite project.

### Install the Plugin

Run the following command to install the `vite-plugin-compression` plugin:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install vite-plugin-compression --save-dev
```

### Configure the Plugin `in vite.config.js`

Open your `vite.config.js` file and add the following configuration:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts" copy
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import path from "path";
import compression from "vite-plugin-compression";

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), compression()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
});
```

### Explanation:

- `vite-plugin-compression` will compress static files when you build your project (compressing them into `.gz` files).
- The compressed files will be created alongside the original files.

## Step 2: Configure Nginx to Serve Gzipped Files

### Objective

You want Nginx to serve `.gz` files that were pre-compressed by Vite without re-compressing them on each request. The Nginx configuration will check for the existence of `.gz` files and serve them instead of the original files.

### Nginx Configuration

Open your Nginx configuration file and modify or add the following settings:

```nginx copy
# HTTP Server Block
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name frontend.lifetek.dev;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

# HTTPS Server Block
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;  # Keep only this line for IPv6 support
    server_name frontend.lifetek.dev;
    gzip_static on;
    # SSL Configuration by Let's Encrypt
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/frontend.lifetek.dev/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/frontend.lifetek.dev/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

    # Root directory and index files
    root /home/frontend;
    index index.html index.htm;

    # Handle client-side routing with React
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}

```

### Explanation:

- `try_files $uri $uri.gz $uri/ /index.html;`: This directive is crucial. It checks if the `.gz` file exists. If it does, Nginx serves the `.gz` file. If not, it will serve the original file.
- gzip_static on;: This tells Nginx to serve pre-compressed `.gz` files without re-compressing them.

### Check and Reload Nginx

Once you've made the configuration changes, you need to check and reload Nginx to apply the changes.

1. Check the configuration:

```bash copy
sudo nginx -t
```

2. Reload Nginx

```bash copy
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Step 3: Test

After configuring Nginx, you can test if Nginx is serving the `.gz` files correctly using a tool like curl.

Run the following command to test:

```bash copy
curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" https://frontend.lifetek.dev
```

If the configuration is correct, you will see that the `.gz` file is served instead of the original file.

## Notes:

- If you're using Vite to compress the files before building, make sure the `.gz` files are created in the build directory.
- Just enable `gzip_static on;` and there's no need to enable gzip compression again in Nginx if you already pre-compressed the files.

With this, you have completed setting up gzip compression and serving the compressed files via Nginx for your Vite project!
